## Conclusion and Recommendation

The pizza sales analysis have shown customers' preference of pizza consumption with the type of pizza preferred and the day of the week in which they are mostly orderd.
From this analysis the pizza market can invest more in the pizza toppings that is best ordered irrespective of the category and produce more pizzas during weekends.
